    "content": "If the Company incurs indebtedness, a portion of its cash flow will have to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness. Typical loan agreements also might contain restrictive covenants which may impair the Company’s operating flexibility. Such loan agreements would also provide for default under certain circumstances, such as failure to meet certain financial covenants. A default under a loan agreement could result in the loan becoming immediately due and payable and, if unpaid, a judgment in favor of such lender which would be senior to the rights of owners of Preferred Stock of the Company. A judgment creditor would have the right to foreclose on any of the Company’s assets resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results or financial condition."

    "title": "Inadequacy Of Funds",
    "content": "We may need to raise additional capital, which might not be available or might be available only on terms unfavorable to us or our investors. In order to continue to operate and grow the business, we will likely need to raise additional capital beyond this current financing round by offering shares of our Common or Preferred Stock and/or other classes of equity. All of these would result in dilution to our existing investors, plus they may include additional rights or terms that may be unfavorable to our existing investor base. We cannot assure you that the necessary funds will be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, or that such funds if raised, would be sufficient. The level and timing of future expenditure will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. If we are not able to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be forced to curtail or abandon our growth plans, which could adversely impact the Company, its business, development, financial condition, operating results, or prospects."
